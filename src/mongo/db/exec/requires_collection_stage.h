 * access to the Collection pointer, the primary purpose of this class is to assume responsibility
 * for checking that the collection is still valid (e.g. has not been dropped) when recovering from
 * yield.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement doSaveStateRequiresCollection() and doRestoreStateRequiresCollection()
 * in order to supply custom yield preparation or yield recovery logic.
 *
 * Templated on 'CollectionT', which may be instantiated using either Collection* or const
 * Collection*. This abstracts the implementation of this base class for use by derived classes
 * which read (e.g. COLLSCAN and MULTI_ITERATOR) and derived classes that write (e.g. UPDATE and
 * DELETE). Derived classes should use the 'RequiresCollectionStage' or
 * 'RequiresMutableCollectionStage' aliases provided below.
